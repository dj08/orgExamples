#+TITLE: Literate SQL with Emacs Org Mode

* Introduction
One of the nice features of org-mode is that it integrates nicely with
various programming languages. Thus, it provides an excellent facility
for literate programming. This is especially useful for documenting
efforts with one-off or rarely visited but useful languages. 

This example documents my efforts with SQLite3, which is a great
implementation for managing data and powering various applications
through this. Conventionally, =csv= is useful for the latter
applications. However, it needs messing up with array indices and
stuff. SQL does not have such requirements, and handles all of these
with built-in commands.
